The main purpose of this project is to apply edge detection techniques to develop a program which 
should recognize coins in an image.
We have used Hough Transform for coin detection.
The following steps are taken in the proposed coin recognition system: 
• Step 1: Develop RGB code for loading database of coin image in MATLAB.
• Step 2: Convert this RGB image to grayscale Image using MATLAB. 
• Step 3: Applied Image Thresholding on Gray Image in MATLAB. 
• Step 4: Crop the coin image automatically in MATLAB. 
• Step 5: Detection of the Edge of Image in MATLAB.
• Step 6: Recognize the coin using its centroid and radius.
